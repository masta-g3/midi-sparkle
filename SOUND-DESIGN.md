# Musical Garden Sound Design Documentation

## Overview

The Musical Garden uses **algorithmic sound synthesis** to create a nature-themed musical playground designed for toddlers. All sounds are generated procedurally in real-time using mathematical functions and noise generation - no audio samples are used. This ensures lightweight performance and organic variation in each playback.

## Sound Architecture

### Core Principles
- **Safety First**: All frequencies limited to 200Hz-4kHz range, volume limited for toddler ears
- **Nature Theme**: Sounds represent natural elements and growth stages
- **Layered Composition**: Background textures (Big Pads) + Melodic elements (Number Pads)
- **Real-time Environmental Control**: Knobs modify all sounds simultaneously
- **No Wrong Notes**: Pentatonic scales and gentle timbres ensure everything sounds musical

## Number Pads - Melodic Elements (16 Pads)

**Musical Role**: Foreground melodies and harmonic accents. These play once when triggered (with softer "off" variations) and are designed to layer beautifully over background textures.

**Scale System**: C Pentatonic (C-D-E-G-A) to ensure all combinations sound harmonious.

**Behavior**: Play "on" sound when pressed, softer "off" sound when released. Can be retriggered for repeated notes.

### Progressive Complexity Logic

The 16 pads are arranged in a 4x4 grid representing growth stages, with increasing harmonic complexity:

```
[ Seeds 1-4  ]  Row 1: Simple bell tones (C pentatonic base octave)
[ Sprouts 5-8]  Row 2: Soft notes (C pentatonic * 1.5x frequency)  
[ Buds 9-12  ]  Row 3: Bright tones (C pentatonic * 2x frequency)
[Flowers13-16]  Row 4: Sparkle notes (C pentatonic * 2.5x frequency)
```

### Flowers (Pads 13-16) üå∫
**Frequency Range**: Highest pentatonic (654.08Hz - 1100Hz, base * 2.5)  
**Timbre**: 'sparkle' - Rich harmonic content  
**Harmonic Content**:
- Fundamental + 2.5x harmonic (0.4x) + 4x harmonic (0.2x)
- Bright decay (1.2 rate)  
- 1.2-second duration, 25% volume

**Musical Purpose**: Most complex and bright melodic content. Provides sparkling melodic accents and the most sophisticated harmonic content.

### "Off" Variations
Each melodic pad has a corresponding "off" sound that plays when the pad is released:
- **Frequency**: 85% of original (slightly lower, more mellow)
- **Duration**: 0.6 seconds (half of "on" duration)  
- **Volume**: 15% (quieter than "on" sounds at 25%)
- **Harmonics**: Reduced harmonic content for softer character
- **Decay**: Faster decay rates for quicker fade

## Technical Implementation

### Audio Engine
- **Sample Rate**: 22,050 Hz (optimized for real-time generation)
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit signed integers
- **Channels**: Stereo (2 channels)
- **Buffer Size**: 512 samples (low latency)

### Safety Features
- **Frequency Limiting**: All sounds constrained to 200Hz-4kHz
- **Volume Limiting**: Maximum volume 0.3 on generation, further limited by master volume
- **Envelope Shaping**: All sounds have soft attack/release to prevent sudden amplitude changes
